1) Shortest Common Superstring:
Program to find shortest common superstring given N strings. Done using greedy approx of an NP complete problem by 
constructing an overlap graph of strings and choosing max spanning tree using heuristics.

2)longest-prefix-ipadd-match.cpp 
Routers use longest prefix matching in case of ip addresses to take decision regarding on
which subnet to forward the ip. So instead of maintaining a table in router and going through it, code makes use of
Trie datastructure which increases search efficiency. :)

3)longest-prefix-string-match.cpp
inspiried the ipadd matching code

4)subnetting.cpp 
Given the maximum number of host and minimum number of users in the network , code returns the subnet that we can use for in 
optimal and space efficient manner.

5)Brainfuck.cpp - Brainf*ck Interpreter in c
Brainf*ck is a type of esoteric programming language, with only 8 instructions:
`> < + - , . [ ]`
These instructions move an internal data pointer, increment and decrement the value at the data pointer, input and output data, and provide simple looping.
brainf*ck was written by Urban Muller with the intent of having a language with the smallest-possible compiler.Code is my own version of the brainf*ck 
interpreter. More info :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Language_design
