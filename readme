longest-prefix-ipadd-match.cpp -> 

Routers use longest prefix matching in case of ip addresses to take decision regarding on
which subnet to forward the ip. So instead of maintaining a table in router and going through it, code makes use of
Trie datastructure which increases search efficiency. :)

longest-prefix-string-match.cpp
inspiried the ipadd matching code

subnetting.cpp ->
Given the maximum number of host and minimum number of users in the network , code returns the subnet that we can use for in 
optimal and space efficient manner.
